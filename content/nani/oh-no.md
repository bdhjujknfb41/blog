    - Authorities: dual enforcement between Commission and NCAs (both belongs to ECN)
      - Reg 1/2003 established dual enforcement regime between Commission and National competition authorities (NCAs)
      - Dual regime requires: rules and procedures; ECN(joint forum, information exchange)
      - position NCAs further harmonised in ECN+ Directive (2019/1/EU)
    - the commission takes precedence over NCAs, Hierarchy between commission and NCAs
      - on the basis of Reg 1/2003, the commission and NCAs have broadly the same powers
      - however "the commission has ultimate but not sole responsibility" in the enforcement of comp law [commission notice on cooperation, OJ 2004 C101/43]
      - when the commission initiates proceedings, NCAs are relieved of competence [art. 11(6) Reg 1/2003]
    - collaboration Commission-NCAs not strongly formalised: division of labor and information exchange
      - Case allocation
        - case allocated to "authority best placed"
          - material link between infringement and territory
          - possibility to gather evidence
          - possibility to terminate infringement
        - collaboration NCAs possible, but only when necessary
        - Commission best placed
          - when affecting ≥ 3 member states
          - when exclusively or more effectively applied by commission
          - when required by "union interest"
      - information exchange
        - notification
          - obligation to inform ECN of investigation [art. 11-3 Reg 1/2003]
          - obligation to inform Commission 30 days prior to NCA decision (Art. 11-4 Reg 1/2003]
        - transfer of information/evidence
          - legally acquired evidence may be transferred between NCAs (art. 12-3 Reg 1/2003]
          - only used against undertakings (not individuals)

  - public enforcement: commission enforcement

    - four distinct stages in a Commission procedure: overview of the stages of Commissions's administrative procedure

      - Input: various way to start proceedings

        - following commission sector inquiry [art. 17 Reg 1/2003]
        - following application for leniency: why is the lenience program the largest feeder of cartel cases? The program itself reinforces cartel instability: Immunity for first firm in; 2d: 30~50% reduction fine; 3rd: 20~30%; hereafter: up to 20%.
        - following whistleblower
        - following complaint:
          - any natural/legal person with legitimate interest and any member state have standing
          - commission can reject

      - investigation stage: behind Commission's doors (those are all non-reviewable acts! Cannot be challenged until appeal against eventual decision)

        - request for information [art.18 reg1/2003]
        - conduct formal interviews and take statements [art 19]
        - power to take and obtain records [art 20 (2c)]

        - inspection of undertaking with judicial authorization [art 20(6)]
        - inspection private premise with judicial authorization [art 21]

      - Inter partes stage: within involved parties (not a trail - but satisfies free trial requirements)

        - after investigation Commission has 3 options

          - close investigation
          - agree commitment decision with undertakings - from here on onwards
          - open formal proceedings

        - statement of objections (SO)

           

          official starting point

          - facts as understood by commission
          - legal analysis on alleged infringement 101/102 TFEU
          - prospective remedies

        - access to file for defendant - inasmuch not bound to confidentiality

        - appointment independent hearing officer presiding over procedure (not substance!)

        - right to be heard in (mainly) written submissions and (rarely) oral hearings

        - last four point —> see [art. 27 reg 1/2003] + [reg 773/2004]

        - Note: not a formal trail, rather fundamental rights requirement before decision

      - decision: various mitigating instruments.

        - Four types of Commission Decisions
          - Finding and termination of infringement [art 7]
            - cease and desist order to terminate cartel or abuse

              - Note: structural remedy = breaking up!
          - interim measures [art 8]
            - rarely applied (but mused in big tech)
            - urgent intervention
              - prema-facie infringement
              - irreparable damage to competition
              - temporary measure
          - commitment decisions [art 9]
            - commitment agreed without finding of infringement
            - at any stage during proceedings

            - nuclear option to prevent decision of NCA (also see [art 11(6)])
            - legally binding statement of non-infringement
        - three types of commission fine
          - fines for procedural infringement [art 23(1)]
            - for failure to cooperate of obstruction of investigation
            - for supplying incorrect, incomplete or misleading information
            - maximum 1% annual turnover
          - fines for substantive infringement [art 23(2)]
            - not a criminal penalty
            - fault must be proven (invent or negligence)
            - must be proportional to gravity and duration of infringement
            - maximum 10% annual turnover
          - periodic penalty payments [art 24]
            - daily rate for defiance of
              - findings and termination of infringement
              - interim measure
              - commitment decision
              - information request
              - inspection request
            - maximum 5% of average daily turnover
        - Pick a side: reviewing the commission's enforcement power
          - Point of view 1: competition law are an affront to free trial and due process provisions. The Commission is policeman, prosecutor, jury, judge, marshall of the court and bail bondsman.”
          - point of view 2: “Only with the wide-ranging powers of a technocratic, non-political body like the European Commission’s Directorate-General Competition can there be an adequate counterweight to the powers of the private sector”
